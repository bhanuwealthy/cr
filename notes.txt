For concurrent data fetching, threadPool is used.
pandas.DataFrame is used to merge, clean, aggregate the {asks, bids}
if we don't use pandas, we'll have to clean and aggregate iteratively.

Though pandas is fast, it barely used all the CPUs,
there is an alternative for DataFrames which uses all available CPUs: Polars(rust core).
TODO: migrate to polars if time permits.

Checklist:
- Parallel fetch the exchange data -- done
- Ratelimit decorator -- done
- Clean & aggregate using pandas for faster calculations -- done.
